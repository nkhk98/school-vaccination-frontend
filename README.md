Frontend for School Vaccination Tracking App
Overview
This is the frontend component of the School Vaccination Tracking App, a full-stack web application designed to manage and track vaccination drives in a school. This user interface (UI) is built using React and provides school coordinators with an intuitive way to:

Manage student records (view, add, edit).

Schedule and manage vaccination drives (view, add, edit).

Update student vaccination statuses.

Generate reports on vaccination data.

This frontend interacts with a backend service (built with Node.js/Express, Python/Flask, or a similar framework) via RESTful APIs to fetch and manipulate data.

Features
Student Management:

View a list of all students.

Add new student records.

Edit existing student information.

Vaccination Drive Management:

View a calendar or list of upcoming and past vaccination drives.

Schedule new vaccination drives, specifying date, time, and location.

Edit details of existing vaccination drives.

Vaccination Status Updates:

View the vaccination status of individual students.

Record and update vaccination details for students (vaccine administered, date).

Reporting:

Generate reports on vaccination data, such as vaccination records for a specific student.

User Interface:

Built with React for a responsive and interactive user experience.

Utilizes modern UI components and styling.

Asynchronous Communication:

Interacts with the backend API asynchronously to provide a smooth user experience.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (version >= 16 recommended)

npm (version >= 8 recommended) or yarn

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/school-vaccination-app-frontend.git

Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd school-vaccination-app-frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Configure API Endpoint:

Create a .env.local file in the root directory of the frontend.

Define the base URL of your backend API:

REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api  # Replace with your actual backend URL

Start the development server:

npm start
# or
yarn start

This will run the frontend application in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

API Interactions
The frontend interacts with the backend API endpoints (as documented in the backend README) to perform CRUD operations on student data, manage vaccination drives, and record vaccination statuses. For example:

Fetching students: GET /api/students

Adding a student: POST /api/students

Fetching vaccination records for a student: GET /api/vaccinations/:studentId

Generating a report: GET /api/report?studentId=...
